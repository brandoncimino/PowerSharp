Contains the root `.psm1` file as well as any additional `.psm1` or `.ps1` files.

[NOTE]
====
To be accessible via type definition (i.e. `[CustomType]`), *Powershell* classes must be loaded via `using module` rather than `Import-Module` (see {psclasshelp})

However, *nested modules* are imported via `Import-Module` (see {psmodmanifest})

As a result, in order for a *Powershell* class to be accessible via type definition it must:

1. Be loaded via `using module` and *not* `Import-Module`
2. Be defined in the *root module* rather than a *nested module*

As a result, it is generally better to define classes as `.cs` files.
